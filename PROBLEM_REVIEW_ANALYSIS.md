# Problem Review Analysis - 123 Problems

## Summary
- **Total Problems**: 123 (from whitelist)
- **Categories**: L1 (40), Patterns (6), L5 Platforms (70), L6 Next-Gen (7)
- **Comprehensive Problems**: 5 (ecommerce, social-media, search, api-gateway, cloud-storage)

## Review Strategy
1. Check if problem is covered by comprehensive problems
2. Check if problem is too abstract/speculative
3. Check if problem has clear, actionable requirements
4. Check if problem teaches practical system design concepts
