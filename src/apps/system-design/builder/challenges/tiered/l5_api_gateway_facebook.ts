  explanation: "Reference Solution for Facebook Global API Gateway (CQRS):\n\n📊 Infrastructure Components:\n- **Read API**: 4 instances handling 2700 read RPS (GET requests)\n- **Write API**: 1 instance handling 300 write RPS (POST/PUT/DELETE).\n- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic using least-connections algorithm. Routes requests to least-busy app server, ideal for long-lived connections (DDIA Ch. 1 - Scalability).\n- **13GB Redis Cache**: In-memory key-value store for hot data. Cache-aside pattern: ~2430 RPS served from cache (~90% hit ratio assumed). Reduces database load and improves p99 latency (SDP - Caching).\n- **PostgreSQL Database**: multi leader configuration with 3 read replicas and 12 shards (sharded by data_id).\n  • Read Capacity: 2700 RPS across 4 database instance(s)\n  • Write Capacity: 300 RPS distributed across leaders\n  • Replication: Asynchronous (eventual consistency, < 1s lag typical)\n- **CDN**: Content delivery network with 150+ global edge locations. Serves static content (images, videos, CSS, JS) from nearest location. Typical latency: < 50ms globally (SDP - CDN).\n- **S3 Object Storage**: Unlimited scalable storage for large files. 99.999999999% durability (eleven nines). Pay-per-use pricing: $0.023/GB/month + transfer costs.\n- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous processing queue for background jobs and event fan-out. Decouples services and provides buffering during traffic spikes (DDIA Ch. 11).\n\n🔄 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):\n- **Justification**: Traffic pattern justifies read/write split (Read: 90.0%, Write: 10.0%, Total: 3000 RPS)\n- **Read API (4 instances)**: Handles GET requests. Optimized for low latency with:\n  • Direct connection to cache (check cache first, DB on miss)\n  • Routes to read replicas (not master) to avoid write contention\n  • Can use eventual consistency (stale data acceptable for reads)\n  • Horizontally scalable: Add instances to handle more read traffic\n- **Write API (1 instance)**: Handles POST/PUT/DELETE requests. Optimized for consistency with:\n  • Routes writes to database master (ensures strong consistency)\n  • Invalidates cache entries on writes (maintains cache freshness)\n  • Fewer instances needed (writes are 10.0% of traffic)\n  • Can use database transactions for atomicity\n- **Benefits** (validated by NFR tests):\n  • Reads don't get blocked by writes (see NFR-P5 test)\n  • Independent scaling: Add read instances without affecting writes\n  • Different optimization strategies (read: cache + replicas, write: transactions + master)\n  • Failure isolation: Read API failure doesn't affect writes (and vice versa)\n- **Trade-offs**: Increased complexity (2 services instead of 1), eventual consistency between read/write paths (DDIA Ch. 7 - Transactions)\n\n💡 Key Design Decisions:\n- **Capacity Planning**: Components sized with 20% headroom for traffic spikes without performance degradation.\n- **Caching Strategy**: Cache reduces database load by ~90%. Hot data (frequently accessed) stays in cache, cold data fetched from database on cache miss.\n- **Replication Mode**: Multi-leader chosen for write scalability (> 100 writes/s). Trade-off: Conflict resolution needed for concurrent writes to same record (DDIA Ch. 5).\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: 12 database shards enable linear scaling. Each shard is independent, can be scaled separately. Query routing based on data_id hash (DDIA Ch. 6 - Partitioning).\n\n⚠️ Important Note:\nThis is ONE valid solution that meets the requirements. The traffic simulator validates ANY architecture that:\n✅ Has all required components (from functionalRequirements.mustHave)\n✅ Has all required connections (from functionalRequirements.mustConnect)\n✅ Meets performance targets (latency, cost, error rate)\n\nYour solution may use different components (e.g., MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL, Memcached instead of Redis) and still pass all tests!"
