  description: `You're building a simple REST API service that processes user requests. Your API is stateless (no database yet!) and performs CPU-bound calculations.

**Starting Point:** Client → Single AppServer

**Your Task:**
Given the throughput requirements below, calculate how many servers you need and design the architecture.

**Throughput Requirements:**
- Average RPS: 2,000 requests/second
- Peak RPS: 10,000 requests/second (during daily peak hours)
- Single server capacity: 2,000 RPS (theoretical maximum)
- OS overhead: 30% (so effective capacity = 2,000 × 0.7 = 1,400 RPS per server)

**Calculation Formula:**
\`\`\`
Servers needed = Peak RPS / (Single Server Capacity × 0.7)
Servers needed = 10,000 / (2,000 × 0.7)
Servers needed = 10,000 / 1,400
Servers needed = ~8 servers (round up for safety)
\`\`\`

**Why 30% overhead?**
- Operating system processes (15%)
- Health checks & monitoring (5%)
- Connection handling & network I/O (5%)
- GC pauses & context switching (5%)

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Calculate server capacity accounting for OS overhead
2. Design for PEAK load, not average load
3. Understand when horizontal scaling is needed
4. Add load balancer to distribute traffic across servers

**Expected Architecture:**
\`\`\`
Client → Load Balancer → [AppServer 1]
                         [AppServer 2]
                         [AppServer 3]

  title: 'Peak vs Average: Why You Must Design for Peak Load',
  description: `A common mistake: "Our average load is only 1,000 RPS, so let's provision for that!"

**Scenario:**
You're running an e-commerce API with these traffic patterns:
- Average RPS: 1,000 (most of the day)
- Peak RPS: 8,000 (lunch hour, 12pm-1pm daily)
- Weekend peak: 15,000 RPS (Saturday morning flash sales)

**What happens if you provision for average?**
- You deploy: 1 server (1,400 RPS capacity)
- At 12pm daily: 8,000 requests arrive
- Server can handle: 1,400 RPS
- Result: 6,600 requests/sec are DROPPED or QUEUED
- User experience: Timeouts, 503 errors, angry customers

**The Rule:**
**ALWAYS design for PEAK load, not average load.**

**Calculation for this problem:**
\`\`\`
Peak RPS: 15,000 (weekend flash sale)
Single server capacity: 2,000 RPS
Effective capacity (30% overhead): 1,400 RPS
Servers needed: 15,000 / 1,400 = 10.7 → 11 servers
\`\`\`

**Cost Consideration:**
- Provisioning for average (1 server): $100/month
- Provisioning for peak (11 servers): $1,100/month
- Cost of downtime during peak: Lost sales, reputation damage

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Understand traffic patterns (average vs peak vs burst)
2. Calculate cost of under-provisioning
3. Learn when to use autoscaling vs static provisioning
4. Design for worst-case, not typical case`,

  description: `Static provisioning wastes money. If your peak is 10× your average, you're paying for idle servers 90% of the time.

**Scenario:**
Social media API with highly variable traffic:
- Baseline: 500 RPS (overnight, 2am-6am)
- Average: 2,000 RPS (typical daytime)
- Daily peak: 8,000 RPS (evening, 6pm-9pm)
- Event spike: 20,000 RPS (breaking news, celebrity tweet)

**Static Provisioning Cost:**
- Need 15 servers for 20k spike (1,400 RPS each)
- Cost: 15 × $100 = $1,500/month
- Utilization overnight: 500 / (15 × 1,400) = 2.4% 😱

**Autoscaling Solution:**
- Minimum instances: 2 (covers baseline 500 RPS)
- Maximum instances: 15 (covers spike 20k RPS)
- Scale up when: CPU > 70% OR RPS > 1,000 per server
- Scale down when: CPU < 30% AND RPS < 500 per server

**Autoscaling Challenges:**
1. **Scale-up lag:** Takes 2-3 minutes to start new servers
   - Solution: Scale proactively (before hitting 100% capacity)
2. **Scale-down delay:** Don't scale down immediately
   - Solution: Wait 10 minutes before removing servers
3. **Thundering herd:** Sudden 0 → 20k RPS spike
   - Solution: Request queue + gradual scale-up

1. Configure autoscaling policies
2. Set min/max instance counts
3. Choose scaling metrics

  description: `You've built an e-commerce API with autoscaling (from Module 1). It handles normal traffic well, but during flash sales, users see errors.

**Current Architecture:**
\`\`\`
Client → Load Balancer → AppServer Pool (autoscale: 5-20 servers)
\`\`\`

**The Flash Sale Scenario:**
- Normal load: 2,000 RPS
- Flash sale starts at 12:00:00 PM
- Traffic spike: 0 → 20,000 RPS in 10 seconds
- Duration: 5 minutes, then drops back to normal

**What Happens (Current System):**
\`\`\`
12:00:00 - Flash sale starts, traffic hits 20,000 RPS
12:00:01 - Load balancer has 5 servers (capacity: 7,000 RPS)
12:00:01 - 13,000 requests/sec are DROPPED (503 errors)
12:00:05 - Autoscaling triggers (CPU > 70%)
12:00:08 - New servers starting...
12:03:00 - New servers ready (now have 15 servers)
12:03:00 - Can finally handle 20,000 RPS
Result: 3 minutes of dropped requests ❌
\`\`\`

**Why Autoscaling Alone Fails:**
1. **Scale-up lag:** Takes 2-3 minutes to start new servers
2. **Thundering herd:** All requests arrive at once
3. **Binary choice:** Accept request OR drop it (no buffering)

**The Problem:**
During the 3-minute scale-up window:
- 13,000 requests/sec × 180 seconds = 2.34 million dropped requests
- Users see: "Service Unavailable" errors
- Lost sales, angry customers, bad PR

**Your Task:**
Add a request queue to buffer burst traffic while autoscaling catches up.

**Solution: Request Queue + Worker Pool**
\`\`\`
Client → LB → Request Queue (Kafka/SQS) → Worker Pool (5-20 servers)
\`\`\`

**How It Works:**
1. LB accepts ALL requests immediately (returns 202 Accepted)
2. Requests are queued (Kafka can buffer millions of messages)
3. Workers process queue at their max capacity (7k RPS with 5 servers)
4. Autoscaling kicks in, workers scale to 15 servers (21k RPS)
5. Queue drains in ~2 minutes

**New Timeline:**
\`\`\`
12:00:00 - Flash sale, 20k RPS hits queue
12:00:01 - Queue accepts all, depth = 20k messages
12:00:01 - 5 workers process at 7k RPS (13k/sec queued)
12:03:00 - Now 15 workers (21k RPS capacity)
12:03:00 - Queue draining faster than filling
12:05:00 - Queue empty, all requests processed ✅
Result: 0 dropped requests, users see "processing..." instead of errors
\`\`\`

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ No dropped requests
- ✅ Smooth user experience ("Your order is being processed")
- ⚠️  Latency: Users wait 30-120 seconds instead of instant response
- ⚠️  Queue monitoring: Need to watch queue depth

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Understand burst vs sustained load
2. Know when queues > horizontal scaling
3. Calculate queue depth and drain rate
4. Design for backpressure (what if queue fills up?)`,

  description: `Your e-commerce platform handles 10,000 writes/second (orders, reviews, inventory updates). Your database is the bottleneck.

**Current Architecture:**
\`\`\`
Client → LB → AppServer Pool → PostgreSQL
\`\`\`

**The Write Bottleneck:**
- Incoming writes: 10,000/sec
- Database capacity: 3,000 writes/sec (single transaction per write)
- Result: 7,000 writes/sec are failing ❌

**Why Is the Database Slow?**
Each write is a separate transaction:
\`\`\`sql
-- User submits order
BEGIN;
  INSERT INTO orders VALUES (...);
COMMIT;  -- Disk fsync (slow!)
-- This takes ~0.3ms per write = max 3,000 writes/sec
\`\`\`

**The Insight: Batching**
Instead of 1 write per transaction, batch 100 writes:
\`\`\`sql
BEGIN;
  INSERT INTO orders VALUES (...);  -- Write 1
  INSERT INTO orders VALUES (...);  -- Write 2
  ...  -- 98 more writes
  INSERT INTO orders VALUES (...);  -- Write 100
COMMIT;  -- One disk fsync for 100 writes!
-- This takes ~1ms per batch = 100,000 writes/sec capacity ✅
\`\`\`

**Your Task:**
Design a write queue + batching worker architecture.

**Solution: Write Queue + Batching Workers**
\`\`\`
Client → LB → AppServer → Write Queue (Kafka)
                             │
                             ▼
                       Batching Workers
                       (batch 100, every 200ms)
                             │
                             ▼
                       PostgreSQL
\`\`\`

**How It Works:**
1. **AppServer:** Receives write request
   - Validates input
   - Enqueues to Kafka
   - Returns "202 Accepted" immediately
   - User sees: "Your order is being processed"

2. **Batching Worker:**
   - Accumulates 100 messages from queue
   - OR waits 200ms (whichever comes first)
   - Executes batch INSERT in one transaction
   - Commits once for all 100 writes

3. **Performance:**
   - Before: 3,000 writes/sec (1 per txn)
   - After: 100,000 writes/sec (100 per txn)
   - **30× improvement!**

**Why This Works:**
- Disk fsync is expensive (~0.3ms)
- Batching amortizes cost across 100 writes
- Queue decouples write spikes from DB

**When NOT to Use Write Queues:**
❌ **Reads:** Users won't wait 200ms for search results
   → Use caching instead (Module 3)
❌ **Real-time critical writes:** Stock trading, payment auth
   → Need synchronous DB writes
✅ **Async-tolerant writes:** Orders, logs, analytics, emails

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Identify write bottlenecks (DB transaction overhead)
2. Calculate batching efficiency gains
3. Design 202 Accepted pattern
4. Know when queues work vs don't work`,

  description: `You've built an API service with load balancing and horizontal scaling (from Module 1). Now users are complaining about slow response times.

**Current Architecture:**
\`\`\`
Client → Load Balancer → AppServer Pool (10 servers) → PostgreSQL
\`\`\`

**The Problem:**
Your API is handling throughput well (10k RPS), but it's SLOW.

**Current Latency Measurements:**
- Average latency: 120ms ✅ (seems fine!)
- P50 (median): 80ms ✅
- P95: 250ms ⚠️
- P99: 450ms ❌ (unacceptable!)
- P999: 2,100ms ❌ (terrible!)

**Your P99 SLO: 200ms**

**Why P99 Matters More Than Average:**
1. **User experience:** The "average" user doesn't exist. 1 in 100 requests sees 450ms.
2. **Fan-out amplification:** If your service calls 10 downstream APIs, probability of hitting P99 = 1 - (0.99)^10 = 9.6%
3. **Early warning:** P99 degrades BEFORE average does. It's your canary.

**Latency Budget Breakdown (Current):**
\`\`\`
Total budget: 200ms
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Network (client → LB):           20ms
Load balancer:                   10ms
AppServer queue wait:            15ms
AppServer processing:            25ms
Database query (PRIMARY ISSUE):  380ms ❌
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL:                           450ms (2.25× over budget!)
\`\`\`

**Root Cause:** Database is the bottleneck for read-heavy workload (100:1 read/write ratio).

**Your Task:**
Fix the P99 latency to meet the 200ms SLO.

**Solution:**
Add a cache layer (Redis) to reduce database load.

**After Adding Cache:**
\`\`\`
Cache hit (95% of requests):     5ms ✅
Cache miss (5% of requests):     380ms (still slow but rare)
Weighted average P99:            ~50ms ✅
\`\`\`

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Understand percentiles (P50, P95, P99, P999)
2. Know why averages lie about tail latency
3. Allocate latency budgets across system hops
4. Identify when caching is needed (read-heavy + high latency)`,

  description: `Your e-commerce API now has great request-response latency (P99 < 200ms thanks to caching). But users report that newly added products don't show up in search results!

**Current Architecture:**
\`\`\`
Client → LB → AppServer Pool → Cache → PostgreSQL
\`\`\`

**The New Requirement:**
Add product search functionality. When a merchant adds a new product, it should appear in search results quickly.

**Two Types of Latency:**

**1. Request-Response Latency (User-Facing) ✅**
- User submits search query
- How long until they see results?
- Target: P99 < 200ms
- Already achieved via caching

**2. Data Processing Latency (Freshness) ❌**
- Merchant adds new product to database
- How long until it appears in search index?
- Target: P99 < 30 seconds
- **Currently: 5 minutes** (batch job runs every 5 minutes)

**The Problem:**

**Current Approach: Batch Processing**
\`\`\`
PostgreSQL ──(poll every 5 min)──> Batch Job ──> Elasticsearch
\`\`\`
- ❌ Freshness: 5 minutes average, up to 10 minutes worst case
- ❌ Inefficient: Scans entire table every 5 minutes
- ❌ Load spikes: Heavy DB queries every 5 minutes

**Why This Matters:**
- Merchant adds product at 2:00:00 PM
- Batch job runs at 2:05:00 PM
- Product appears in search at 2:05:15 PM
- **Data processing latency: 5 minutes 15 seconds** ❌

**Your Task:**
Design a real-time data pipeline to achieve P99 freshness < 30 seconds.

**Solution: Change Data Capture (CDC) + Event Streaming**

**New Architecture:**
\`\`\`
PostgreSQL ──(CDC connector)──> Kafka Topic
                                    │
                                    ├──> Search Indexer → Elasticsearch

                                    └──> Analytics → Data Warehouse
\`\`\`

**How CDC Works:**
1. CDC connector (Debezium) monitors PostgreSQL transaction log
2. Captures all INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE events in real-time
3. Publishes events to Kafka topic (< 1 second lag)
4. Multiple consumers process events independently

**Data Processing Latency Breakdown:**
\`\`\`
Target: 30 seconds P99
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CDC capture (DB → Kafka):          2s
Kafka transport:                    1s
Search indexer processing:          8s
Elasticsearch indexing:             12s
Cache invalidation:                 2s
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL:                              25s ✅ (under 30s target!)
\`\`\`

**Why CDC > Batch:**
1. **Real-time:** Events captured immediately (not every 5 min)
2. **Efficient:** Only changed rows sent (not full table scan)
3. **Scalable:** Multiple consumers can process same events
4. **Decoupled:** Search, cache, analytics update independently

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Distinguish request-response latency from data processing latency
2. Set freshness SLOs for derived data
3. Understand CDC (Change Data Capture) patterns
4. Design event-driven architectures`,
